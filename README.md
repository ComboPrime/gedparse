gedparse
========

Gedparse is a Drupal 7 module that parses a GEDCOM file and displays
genealogical information. It is definitely a work in progress and
may not handle every type of field, or even (at the moment) features
like sources.

But feel free to fork it on GitHub or (once it's on Drupal.org)
submit a patch!
